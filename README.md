- 👋 Hi, I’m Jordan Rodriguez!
- 👀 I’m interested in population genetics and methods/bioinformatic tools development for exploring evolutionary and ecological questions that handle big data. I spend most of my lab time doing dry-lab tasks & exploring/developing methods for current research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about protein embeddings, Deep Learning-based Language Models, machine learning & deep learning for exploring evolutionary concepts, stochastic modelling, and advanced biological statistics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on evolutionary studies handling & analyzing big data/genomic data.
- 📫 How to reach me: jrodrig8@uoregon.edu
