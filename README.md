- 👋 Hi, I’m Jordan Rodriguez!
- 👀 I’m interested in methods and bioinformatic tools development for exploring evolutionary and ecological questions that handle big data. I spend most of my lab time doing dry-lab tasks & developing methods for current research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Microbial evolution, Microbial species delineation, Meta-genome assembed genomes (MAGs), machine learning & deep learning for exploring evolutionary concepts, building linear models, and advanced biological statistics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on evolutionary studies handling & analyzing big data.
